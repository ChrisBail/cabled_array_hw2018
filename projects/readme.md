## Geohackweek 2017 Projects

## [Geolocated social media to measure trail use](SocialMediaTrails)

Provide managers of public lands with useful data on visitation rates for hard-to-monitor areas like backcountry trails, using geolocated social media as a data source. Develop spatial models to explore visitation patterns.
