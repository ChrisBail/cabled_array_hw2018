Welcome to the main Github repository for the CabledArrayHackWorkshop!

CabledArrayHackWorkshop (CAHW) is a 3-day hack event to be held at the University of Washington School of Oceanography. Participants will learn about open source technologies used to analyze [Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI)](https://oceanobservatories.org/) [Regional Cabled Array](http://www.interactiveoceans.washington.edu) datasets. Mornings will consist of interactive lectures, and afternoon sessions will involve facilitated exploration of datasets and hands-on software development.
